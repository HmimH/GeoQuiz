# GeoQuiz
TSOHA-project, quizzing users on flags, capitals and countries, maybe

The aim is to create a site which allows the user to quiz themselves on countries, their flags, capitals, and maps depending on what kinds of databases for them I'll be able to dig up. In addition to this I may add a system for logins and high scores, both personal and universal.

E.g.

Which country's capital is Sofia?
1) Japan
2) Senegal
3) Bulgaria
4) Belarus

Update! 24th of September
Going pretty terribly to be honest. Innumerable bugs and the textbook examples on the tsoha-page don't work even when followed exactly. Managed to make some of them work with hours and hours of troubleshooting, but this is as far as I'll come today. I am not learning anything and the code certainly isn't benefitting from spending another 16 hours trying to find out which singular word destroys everything this time, only to find a new error code behind it.
As for where it is at:
I have sql, but cannot connect it to the app.
I have many different templates for the app, some of which are obsolete.
I have some vague notions of what the app interface may look like.
Etc.
Cheers.
