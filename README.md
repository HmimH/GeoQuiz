# GeoQuiz
TSOHA-project, quizzing users on flags, capitals and countries, maybe

The aim is to create a site which allows the user to quiz themselves on countries, their flags, capitals, and maps depending on what kinds of databases for them I'll be able to dig up. In addition to this I may add a system for logins and high scores, both personal and universal.

E.g.

Which country's capital is Sofia?
1) Japan
2) Senegal
3) Bulgaria
4) Belarus
